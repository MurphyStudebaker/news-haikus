On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __4__ based on the following criteria:

1  I was not able to compile the program due to insufficient information in the README.md file.

2  At least one of the programs has syntax errors and does not compile

3  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

4  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically: It compiles and runs, but when I choose an option (1,2,3) it gives an error. 

5  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not perform according to the documentation or does not comply with Chapman Coding Standards.
Specifically:

6  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented, following the Chapman Coding Standards.
